Q] What is PluginObject?
A] PluginObject is an end-all solution to embedding browser based plugins. For
   those of you familiar with SWFObject, PluginObject is remarkably similar, 
   except with PluginObject you are not just limited to the Flash Plugin.

Q] What plugins are supported?
A] See OPTIONS (below) for more information.

Q] I already use SWFObject, is there any point in using PluginObject instead?
A] Most likely, no. If you are using SWFObject already and your site only
   utilizes the Flash plugin then there is no need to update your site. 
   However if you use multiple plugins across your site then updating from
   your current solution to PluginObject may hold certain advantages.

Q] What are the advantages of PluginObject?
A] 1. Multiple plugin support. PluginObject already supports over 7 different
   types of plugins and with PluginObject's architecture being easy to extend
   then it has never before been easier to embed plugins.
   2. Same code, different plugin. The same code is used to embed all plugin
   types, so there is not much to learn.
   3. Autoloading javascript libraries. If you're using a dynamic page and you
   are not sure what plugin will be required on your page, then don't worry, 
   don't load all the libraries regardless of wether or not you will use them.		
   PluginObject takes care of everything, simply load the base pluginobject.js
   file and embed your plugins as normal. PluginObject will dynamically load
   the required javascript as soon as the library is required.
   4. Automatic placeholders across all plugins even if the plugin does not
   support it! Every wanted an easy way of providing placeholder support on a
   plugin that doesn't support it, well now any plugin that is supported by
   PluginObject can make use of placeholders. (Placeholders are images that
   are loaded in-place of the plugin when the page loads. The user is then 
   required to 'activate' the plugin by clicking on the placeholder)

Q] Which library should I use, PluginObject or SWFObject?
A] The answer is realistically either as they both provide the same 
   functionality. However if you are using multiple plugins on your site then 
   PluginObject provides a uniform way of embedding them. But if you are 
   using only the Flash plugin then SWFObject is probably the best choice for 
   you as SWFObject is only 8kb and the combination of the PluginObject and 
   Flash Plugin code is 14.5kb.
